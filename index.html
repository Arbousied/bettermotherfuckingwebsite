  <body>
    <div class="Jerem">And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</div>
    <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort <br>to improve this shit.</h2>
    <div class="Joe">7 fucking declarations.</div>
    <p class="Jeff">That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into <br>this easy-to-read masterpiece.
      It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all <br>the
      glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
    <ul class="Bob">
    <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
    <li>  <em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
    <li>  <em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
    <li>  The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits <br>your site</li>
    <li>  Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
    <div class="Jeff">You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. <br>Here's how.</div>
    <h2>Let it breathe</h2>
    <p class="Jeff">Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building.
      <br>Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping.
      <br>The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body
      <br>copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
    <div class="Jeff">If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see
      <br>a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</div>
    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
    <p class="Jeff">Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real
      <br>life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's
      <br>background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping
      <br>declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
    <p class="Jeff">I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body
      <br>copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for
      <br>print, not the screen.</p>
    <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
    <p class="Jeff">Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a
      <br>line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80
      <br>and users might actually read more than one sentence of your
      <br>worthless dribble.</p>
      <h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
      <p class="Jeff">I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying
        <br>is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are
        <br>broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and
        <br>accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web
        <br>designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
